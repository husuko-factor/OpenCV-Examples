#### C++ application which can:
1. Using this application a path can be traced of the object movement in the frame.
2. You can set the range of color which you want to trace the path (In code I have set values for red color)

Yellow 22- 38
Green 38-75
Blue 75-130
Violet 130-160
Red 160-179

Code written using OpenCV C++.
To compile the code write the following command in terminal:

`g++ -o [output_file_name] main.cpp 'pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv'`
